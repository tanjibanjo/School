BOOLEAN LOGIC
	true(1), false(0)
	
	and gates are two transistors in the same line
	or gates use parallel transistors
	not gates use an additional gate to negate the current basically
		(visually)
	and gate - looks like a big D
	or gate - spaceship
	not gate - triangle with dot

NAND AND NOR GATES
	and gate then not gate - results in nand gate, which looks like a D with a dot
	and with inverted output

	or and then not - results in nor gate - 
	
	-these are called universal gates

WE CAN BUILD ANY OPERATION WITH ONLY USING NAND GATES

PROOFS
	1)NOT(x) = (x NAND x) - make not by using a nand gate with the same input 
	2)(x AND y) = NOT(x NAND y)

BUILDING AN AND GATE
		with the universal gates, if you short circuit the inputs, it becomes invert
	take a NAND GATE then negate it with a short circuited nand gate?
	
	short circuit by outputting the output of the first to both the transistors of the next 		gate nand gate
	
	-code-

	CHIP And{
		IN a, b;
		OUT out;
		PARTS:
			Nand (a=a, b=b, out=w);
			Nand (a=w, b=w, out=out);
	}
