----------------------------
BOOLEAN LOGIC
	true(1), false(0)
	
	and gates are two transistors in the same line
	or gates use parallel transistors
	not gates use an additional gate to negate the current basically
		(visually)
	and gate - looks like a big D
	or gate - spaceship
	not gate - triangle with dot

NAND AND NOR GATES
	and gate then not gate - results in nand gate, which looks like a D with a dot
	and with inverted output

	or and then not - results in nor gate - 
	
	-these are called universal gates

WE CAN BUILD ANY OPERATION WITH ONLY USING NAND GATES

HARDWARE DESIGN LANGUAGE
	-every connection has to be named in hdl
	-describe each part one at a time
	-nand gates make up the foundation, but then each component can build upon itself, 
		creating more complicated circuits

HARDWARE CONSTRUCTION
	-architects and developers

	architect decides which chips are needed
	for each chip, architect creates a chip API, test script, and compare file - needed to run HDL
		
	with this, harware developers can actually build the chips and HDL
	
	developers get a stub file, needing implementation, a test file, and compare file
	-interface, what the chip is supposed to do, how to test
	

BUILDING AN AND GATE
		with the universal gates, if you short circuit the inputs, it becomes invert
	take a NAND GATE then negate it with a short circuited nand gate?
	
	short circuit by outputting the output of the first to both the transistors of the next 		gate nand gate
	
	-code-

	CHIP And{
		IN a, b;
		OUT out;
		PARTS:
			Nand (a=a, b=b, out=w);
			Nand (a=w, b=w, out=out);
	}
PROOFS
	1)NOT(x) = (x NAND x) - make not by using a nand gate with the same input 
	2)(x AND y) = NOT(x NAND y)
	3)A OR B = NAND(Not(a), Not(b))
	4)XOR = (a and NOT(b)) or ((Not(a) and b))

MULTI BIT BUSES
	
	sometimes manipulate a group of bits together, 'bus'
	HDLs will usually provide some notation for this

	
MULTIPLEXOR (mux)
	
	has three inputs, a, b, and sel
		if sel == 0 output a
		else output b

	-can use this to program gates!

DEMULTIPLEXOR
	
	like the inverse of the multiplexor,
	receives one input and sel, and based on the sel, outputs either a or b
	
		if sel == 0, {a,b}={in,0}
		else, {a,b}={0,in}
