- notes on the first two videos for the Assembly Language Programming class

-------------
ORIGINS
	-abacus was first operating 'calculator'
		-astrolade - calculate location at sea
		-'computer' was a person who did things with calculations
		-step reckoner was first machine that could do add/sub/div/mult in automated way
	
	-used to use sq rt tables 
		-military was one of the first to incorporate these computers and maths
		-range tables told them the angles for canons for distance
	
	-Difference engine (Charles Babbage)
		-could compute polynomials
		-abandoned but eventually finished in 1991

	-Analytical engine
		-basically the first idea of a general computer
		-idea was never built and way ahead of its time
		-Ada Lovelace wrote hypothetical programs for the engine
			-worlds first programmer?
	
	-US Govt needed help to complete the census because America was too big
		-Herman Hollerith(?) used punch cards
		-10x faster than manual completion
		-created a tabulating company, later merged with others to make IBM
-------------
EVOLVING COMPUTERS
	-one of the largest computers built was the harvard mark 1
	-built for the allies in ww2
	-hundreds of miles of wire lol
		-ran sims for manhatten 

	RELAY - kind of like a faucet, uses a control wire to open and close the circuit using a 		current (electromechanical)
		
		-in the 50s, only flip about 50 times a second
		-complex functions could take over a minute
		-wear was bad
	DIODE - an electric component that permits the one way flow of current
		
	-Vacuum tubes using a triode helped a lot, many times faster, expensive, and were used 			in radio sets, and computers

	-collosus mk 1 was one of the first huge computers that used vacuum tubes
		-decode nazi stuff
	-programming done by plugging wires into certain boards to set the computer up for 
		whatever function desired
	
	ENIAC - first treu general purpose programmable computer - 5000-10000 operations per 
		second
	
	TRANSISTORS - switch that can be opened or closed by applying electrical power via control wire - two electrodes separated by a material that is a semi-conductor
	
		-solid state component

-------------
BOOLEAN LOGIC & LOGIC GATES
	
	BINARY -of two states - how computers can store info
		-TRUE/FALSE - 0 and 1 ( 1 is true )
	TERNARY -of three states
		-ternary operators!
	
	BOOLEAN ALGEBRA 
		-made by george boole
		-logic equations to represent truth
		-not and or
		
		-we can easily use transistors for bools
		-not gates on transistors were built on the circuit, uses ground
		-and gate takes two inputs and one output - uses two transistors sidebyside
		-or gates use two transistors in parallel
		(visual representations)
		-not - tri dot
		-and - D
		-or - spaceship

		XOR (exclusive or)
		- like a regular or, but if both are true, xor is false)
			-only true when one of the two inputs are true, not both
			-or gate w a smile (visually)
