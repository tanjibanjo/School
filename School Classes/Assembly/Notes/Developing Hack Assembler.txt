// notes on making a hack assembler in any computer language - java, python, cpp?

I. Contract

	- develop HackAssembler program that translates assembly programs into binary code
	- source code is a txt file named ___.asm
	- generated code is a txt file named ___.hack
	
	- program should create or override a .hack file of the same name

II. Design
	// 4 software modules that stand alone and can be unit tested individually
	
	- Parser: unpacks each instruction into its underlying fields
	- Code: translates each field into its corresponding binary value
	- SymbolTable: manages the symbol table 
	- Main: initializes the I/O files and drives the process

	// classes? OOP for sure, then have objects of parser/code/table running in main

III. Implementation
	
	- first, make an assembler that works without symbols
	- develop ability to handle the symbols separately
	- combine together
