Module 1 notes for Assembly

----------------------------
BOOLEAN LOGIC
	true(1), false(0)
	
	and gates are two transistors in the same line
	or gates use parallel transistors
	not gates use an additional gate to negate the current basically
		(visually)
	and gate - looks like a big D
	or gate - spaceship
	not gate - triangle with dot

NAND AND NOR GATES
	and gate then not gate - results in nand gate, which looks like a D with a dot
	and with inverted output

	or and then not - results in nor gate - 
	
	-these are called universal gates

WE CAN BUILD ANY OPERATION WITH ONLY USING NAND GATES

HARDWARE DESIGN LANGUAGE
	-every connection has to be named in hdl
	-describe each part one at a time
	-nand gates make up the foundation, but then each component can build upon itself, 
		creating more complicated circuits

HARDWARE CONSTRUCTION
	-architects and developers

	architect decides which chips are needed
	for each chip, architect creates a chip API, test script, and compare file - needed to run HDL
		
	with this, harware developers can actually build the chips and HDL
	
	developers get a stub file, needing implementation, a test file, and compare file
	-interface, what the chip is supposed to do, how to test
	

BUILDING AN AND GATE
		with the universal gates, if you short circuit the inputs, it becomes invert
	take a NAND GATE then negate it with a short circuited nand gate?
	
	short circuit by outputting the output of the first to both the transistors of the next 		gate nand gate
	
	-code-

	CHIP And{
		IN a, b;
		OUT out;
		PARTS:
			Nand (a=a, b=b, out=w);
			Nand (a=w, b=w, out=out);
	}
PROOFS
	1)NOT(x) = (x NAND x) - make not by using a nand gate with the same input 
	2)(x AND y) = NOT(x NAND y)
	3)A OR B = NAND(Not(a), Not(b))
	4)XOR = (a and NOT(b)) or ((Not(a) and b))

MULTI BIT BUSES
	
	sometimes manipulate a group of bits together, 'bus'
	HDLs will usually provide some notation for this

	
MULTIPLEXOR (mux)
	
	has two inputs, a, b, and selection
		if sel == 0 output a
		else output b

	-can use this to program gates!
	-can implement with two ang gates and an or gate, inverted twice** 
		-becomes three nand gates
	-mux do not combine input signals into an output signal, they are like selectors
	

DEMULTIPLEXOR (demux)
	
	like the inverse of the multiplexor,
	receives one input and sel, and based on the sel, outputs either a or b
	
		if sel == 0, {a,b}={in,0}
		else, {a,b}={0,in}
	-one of the outputs gets connected to the input bsaed on the # matching the selection

MICROPROCESSORS
	-arithmetic and logic unit (ALU) is what makes up the mp
	-registers hold the data that the alu needs to do calculations, when it finishes the answer returns to the register(s)
	-in order to tell the ALU what to do, we need the control unit to give it tasks
	-then we need the Instruction Register to tell the control unit what to be done
	-IR gets instruction from memory
	-memory needs an address that comes from the program counert (PC)
	-PC is controlled/updated by the control unit

BINARY ARITHMETIC (ALU)
	-how to convert from decimal to binary?
		EX: 24
		-divide by 2s
		24/2 = 12R0 //if remainder is 0, keep going
		12/2 = 6R0 
		6/2 = 3R0
		3/2 = 1R1
		-now use the remainders, from the end up as the binary
		24 (in decimal) = 11000 (binary)
	 -SUBTRACTION
		-borrowing is bad, so we have to account for that first
