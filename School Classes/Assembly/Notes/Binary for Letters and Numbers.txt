notes on binary

-------------------------------
BINARY
	- is a base 2, so each consecutive column is 2X the last
	128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1

BINARY ADDITION
	- start with the right most, just like normal
	- 1 + 1 = 10, so 0 and carry the 1 
	- 1 + 1 + 1 (carried) = 3, or 11 - so 1 and carry the 1
	- so on and so forth

8 BIT
	- byte, 8 bits (0-255)
	- so 8 bit games only have 255 values for colors, much less than these days

32/64 BIT COMPUTERS
	- up to 4.3 billion values on 32 bit graphics
-------------------------------
WHAT ABOUT FLOATS?
	- IEEE - standard stores decimals kind of like scientific notation

		in a floating point number, first bit is for sign (positive or negative), next 8 
		bits for the exponent, then the reset for the significand 
	
LETTERS AS NUMBERS
	- ASCII - 7 bit code to hold values of letters and symbols (128 total values)
		- became 8 bit to extend to 256 values
	- interoperability - now computers from different companies can transfer data 
	- this didn't work for different languages

	- UNICODE - universal coding scheme to encompass every language and symbol around world

-------------------------------
COMPUTATION - HOW IS IT DONE?

ARITHMATIC UNIT
	HALF ADDER
		- two inputs, outputs sum and carry
		- uses an xor gate, and an and gate
	FULL ADDER
		- three inputs, two outputs are the same
		- use half adder to add A + B
			- feed that result and C to another half adder
			- output from there the sum
			- then use an or gate on the carries from the halfs to output the carry
	8 BIT ADDER
		- take bits one by one from each 8 bit number, and send to half adder
		- then, send the next pair of bits along with the carry from the first adder to 
			full adders
		- continue on until all 8 half been added
		- the carry goes into each consecutive adder, then out from the last one
LOGIC UNIT
	
ALU (both, but up a level or abstraction)
	- has two inputs, and an operation code(4 bits)
	- operation code tells what to perform
	- output is 8 bits
	- there are also flags, that are bit sized (overflow, zero, negative)

-------------------------------
2'S COMPLIMENT
	- give up a bit to represent the sign of the number
	- if 0, positive, 1 is negative
		ex: 0000 (0), 0001 (1), 0010 (2)
	
	- for negative numbers (-x) represent using the positive number 2^n - x
		ex: so for 4 bits, -3 would be (2^4 - 3) = 13 
			(-3)  1101 = 13
			(-4)  1100 = 12

COMPUTING -X
	- input: x
	- output: -x(2s compliment)
	- if we solve this, we can subtract!

2^n - x = 1 + (2^n - 1) - x

	- 2^n - 1 = 11111111
	- this - x creates the flip of all the bits basically
