Notes on unity scripting, using C#
***********************************
public class CLASS : MonoBehaviour {...functions...}

***********************************
SCRIPTS
-------
can add scripts and create within the finder(ui)

---------
VARIABLES
---------
declare and initialize variables just like cpp, semicolon to finish

	-Debug.Log() //access value of any variable in the game
		Debug.Log(myInt); //example
		-if you attach that to an object in game, press play, value is shown in the 
		 console
functions still use return type and {} - just like cpp, name functions with PascalCase
parameters same as cpp

***********************************
SYNTAX
------
-dot notation
-semicolon terminates statements, just like cpp
//for comments
/* ... */ for multiline
- floats are initialized with 'f' after the number
	ex: float num1 = 5.0f
-=, +=, *= remain


DELTA TIME - Time.deltaTime //use to keep track of time passing in a consistent manner

INPUT - Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.INSERT_KEY_HERE) //replace that with whatever key you want

***********************************
LOOPS
-----

- all the same as cpp!

***********************************
SCOPE
-----
always remember the access modifiers for variables defined in the class, not just in functions

- public - accessed from outside the class and editable/shown in the unity inspector**
	- good to use for testing within the editor
	- variables modified in the inspector while running will not be changed or saved**

- private - is the default modifier for variables in a class!!
	- good to write it out anyways

USE 'NEW' KEYWORD FOR CREATING INSTANCES OF CLASSES

***********************************
AWAKE AND START

- TWO SCRIPTS CALLED AUTOMATICALLY WHEN SCRIPT IS LOADED
- awake is called first and is good for setting up references between scripts and initialization
- start is called after, before the first update, but only if the script component is enabled
	- this allows you to delay any part of the init code until its needed

** these are only called once 

***********************************
UPDATE AND FIXED UPDATE
-----------------------
void Update() 
	is called every frame, and is used for all types of things 
-it is not consistent, if frames take longer than the next the update is called irregularly

void FixedUpdate()
	is will have the same amnt of time between calls
-anything that has a RigidBody should use fixed update for physics stuff

***********************************
MonoBehavior scripting wizard
-----------------------------

cntrl-SHIFT-'M' to launch wizard
	- then choose the methods you want to add
	- press okay to insert methods into the code
	- i think this lets you browse special functions available within unity to implement

***********************************
VECTORS
-------
- a line drawn between two points
- have a length, known as magnitude

2D VECTORS
	- goes from origin to any point in a plane, implying it has a direction
	- good to use for distance and relative computing
	- also used for velocity
3D VECTORS
	- work the same as 2D but extrapolated into the z axis, depth
	
Unity works on a left handed coordinate system
	- meaning, thumb is x axis, finger is y
	- finding the magnitude is the same as 2d - sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)
	HELPER FUNCTION - use Vector3.magnitude() function to get the magnitude easy!

DOT PRODUCT - takes the values of two vectors and produces a scaler, a single value
	- take their parts and multiply them together to find the sum of the products
	- (Ax * Bx) + (Ay * By) + (Az * Bz) = Dot Product
		- IF THE DOT PRODUCT OF TWO VECTORS IS 0, THEY ARE PERPENDICULAR
	HELPER FUNCTION - Vector3.Dot(VectorA, VectorB)

CROSS PRODUCT
	-instead of returning a scalar, returns a vector that is perpendicular to the first two
	Vector3.Cross(VectorA, VectorB)

	- one use is if you were wanting to apply rotational torque, 
		- if you know the direction facing, and what direction it needs to face, can 
			find the axes to rotate on
***********************************
ENABLING AND DISABLING COMPONENTS
---------------------------------
GetComponent<COMPONENT>(); //returns a component attached to the object

to enable/disable components, use the .enabled flag and set to !component.enabled; 
	-using ! to invert the value, making it a toggle instead of writing xt code
	-scripts are also components and you can use the .enable to toggle them too

- deactivating a parent object will deactivate the child component as well
- to check if active in the scene or heirarchy
	object.activeSelf();
	object.activeInHeirarchy(); //can debug.log these to see what's going on

***********************************
TRANSLATE AND ROTATE
---------------------
-translate
	- put into update()
	- transform.Translate(new Vector(0, 0, 1); // updating every frame 
		-can actually work around this by multiplying Vector3.forward (built in) by T
		 ime.deltaTime and moveSpeed
		
	- now this is meters per second, not meters per frame**
	- moving backwards, use -Vector3.forward to negate the call

-Rotate
	- transform.Rotate(Vector3.up, turnspeed (or -turnSpeed) * Time.deltaTime);
	- Vector3 works in the local axis, not the world axis
	- careful with using rotate with physics objects

***********************************
LOOK AT
-------

- make a game object look at another object in the world
INSIDE OF UPDATE:
	- can call transform.LookAt(target); //target is type transform variable in the script class
	- this look at script can attach to the camera, then apply the target object within the inspector (editor)
