* Fix merged Token names bug introduced in rev9438 by adding a underscore between the file index and unnamed class/struct/enum Token index. See discussion in http://forums.codeblocks.org/index.php/topic,18542.0.html.
* Fix bug ##19186, http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&bug_id=19186&group_id=5358, when a file was re-parsed, the Token name for the unnamed struct always changed, this is because we use a global counter for all the unnamed struct/enum. Solution: let these counters file related, which means each file have its own counter staring from zero, and the Token name has a file index prefix like __UnnamedStruct70, where 7 is refer to a file index, the 0 donates the unnamed struct counter. Also, the counter is started from 0, it was 1 before. Reparse does not change the file index, so we will not produce garbage token names.
